# Release workflow: builds the Electron app and (when fully configured) publishes to GitHub Releases.
# Trigger: push a tag matching v* (e.g. git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags)
#
# To enable publishing:
# 1. Configure electron-builder in package.json (publish, productName, etc.).
# 2. Add GH token with repo permissions (e.g. GITHUB_TOKEN or a PAT) for publishing.
# 3. Uncomment the "Build and publish" step below and remove the placeholder.
# 4. For signed Windows .exe: configure code signing (certificate, env vars). See electron-builder docs.
