Hi, are you still looking for devs? for the tracker app
chamero._.

 — 30/11/25, 14:51
Yes, finding someone who understand what i want is difficult, im not the best at explaining perhaps.
very rough draft, im not good at front end ect
Imagen
only really had the media and weight one working(wait manual and quick entry on the main page here) 
I want more extenstive tracking tabs on side for each mini category to see a lot of data later on ect
and so on
Lmk what timezone/country you're from , if you understand kinda what i want and your past workk or anyhing you have to share. I have to work right now, ill get back to you later.

What I understood is that it’s basically a generalized tracking app so the user can track their daily activities, kind of like a way to keep their life organized. On a daily basis they can see how many hours they’ve played, have a to‑do list, see how their weight is going with a graph showing the changes, how many hours they’ve spent on social media, what exercises they did that day, how their diet is going, and TV/books (which seems to be for series or similar things). In the calendar view, I’m assuming you want a place where the user can see how things have been going on other days, months, or even years, so they can prepare for upcoming days and so on. I’m not completely sure what you want to do in the Assets section.
Also, based on your request, I understand that on the main screen (the picture you sent me) you’d like just a direct summary of the day, but you want the sidebar to be the “extensive tracking” area, with separate sections by category: Media, Weight, Exercise, Gaming, Tasks, Series.
This is what I understood about the system. If my time zone works for you and you think I understood the project correctly, let me know so we can keep talking about it.

Everything looks good. How's the english without translation/ai?
And how much do you think you'd quote me for project then how much for additions or revisions?
I think I'd like to expand it a lot over months/year.
It's just personal use, random stuff I'll want later.
DaniPP — 30/11/25, 19:11
My current English level lets me understand everything you say perfectly—no issues there. Honestly, my practical written/spoken English is the problem; dyslexia makes organizing words before speaking/writing tougher since it's not my native language. I can speak it normally, but it might sound basic or less natural than a native's. That's why I always double-check with AI to ensure everything's clear and comprehensible.
For any additions during development or reformatting your code... even though the functionality's there, it'll take me a bit to get familiar with what/how you've written and the logic (sometimes starting from scratch feels easier and faster). But no problem—upfront payment with additions along the way, honestly $100-200. What do you think if I offer mobile + desktop development for $200-300? With add-ons, and I'd keep developing until the project looks exactly how you want (not going to ultra-extreme levels, of course). Or want to negotiate another price? What's your budget?
My work method is to always send daily progress reports every night (Ecuador time) to wrap up the day, with constant client feedback to avoid any errors or long-term issues
chamero._.

 — 30/11/25, 20:25
All this sounds fantastic. I expect starting from scratch, I'm not a programmer and i used a lot of junk code. 

We need to work out method of payment, mabye partial payments as we go? 

Also would you be able to do mobile later if I like the electron version or is it easier and less work to do both together?
chamero._.

 — 30/11/25, 20:26
Mabye just start with small payments for front end and make sure we can communicate and figure out my goals before committing to everything. 
DaniPP — 30/11/25, 20:37
My preferred payment method is Binance, would that work for you? If Binance isn’t possible, then we can use PayPal. It’s 8:33 here, so maybe today I’ll just prepare everything. Tomorrow (Monday) I’ll start working on the frontend and send you what I get done that day. My plan for tomorrow is to build the frontend prototype, so as you said, we first focus on the frontend and once we have everything as it should be, we do the first payment. We can do small payments for the frontend like you suggested and keep going step by step while I develop everything
chamero._.

 — 30/11/25, 20:40
Alright this sounds great. Just do bare minimum front end to make sure we're good.

I'm fairly busy with work for next 4 days. I'll reply when I have a chance.

Is binance crypto? I have some crypto on a different platform.
DaniPP — 30/11/25, 20:42
Sure, no problem, good luck with work btw. And yes, Binance is crypto, but the idea would be to do the payment in Tether/USDT, I don’t know if you know it, it’s like a substitute for the dollar. I’ll build the MVP of the frontend and I’ll be sending you daily screenshots anyway and let you know when it’s finished. Whenever you want to send me feedback or if something doesn’t match how you like it or how you had it planned, feel free to tell me and I’ll change it or improve it with no problem
chamero._.

 — 30/11/25, 20:43
Alright  I may look into setting up account if I can later. 

Thanks!, Talk to you later
DaniPP — 30/11/25, 20:43
Cya, have a nice night or day or afternoon, and have some great days!
chamero._.

 — 30/11/25, 22:18
I forgot about tech stack. I'd prefer electron desktop app  js/ts with tailwind and sql.  Vue isn't a must if you know something better.  Open to other ideas.
DaniPP — 30/11/25, 22:22
Hey, since you’re here, could I know your time zone? That way we can communicate better. Also, I hadn’t fully read the part where you asked if it’s better to do the mobile version later or at the same time. I’d prefer to do the desktop version first and then, as I said, if I see that you like it, we can move on to the mobile version.

For the tech stack, I have no problem using Electron, and I’d prefer TypeScript. For the database, I’d most likely use SQL Server LocalDB so all the data is handled directly on your own computer. Depending on how it works, I’ll try to make everything run on your device for long-term convenience, like data storage and app functionality. But if there is any complication (I don’t think so) and there’s even a small need to use a VPS or something in the cloud, I’ll let you know over the days as I keep developing the app
chamero._.

 — 30/11/25, 22:23
Timezone isn't really accurate, I work odd hours 😆
chamero._.

 — 30/11/25, 22:24
That sounds good
DaniPP — 30/11/25, 22:24
Oh, I see then, no problem
btw, since you’re here, could I get access to the old code? There are some things I can’t quite understand, like the assets view. Maybe by looking at the old code I can figure it out. I need to know how that page would look, because it’s the only one I can’t fully picture in order to develop the frontend MVP
chamero._.

 — 30/11/25, 22:26
Dark mode, quick and easily entered data on home page,
Imagen
Imagen
I made assets to upload pictures for stuff I'll enter
Not sure how else I was supposed to do it, I was completely new to coding and stuff. You could probably come up with better idea
I think it worked pretty well, aside from my resolution and sizing issues.
I was uploading via clipboard mostly
I have to go again. I May reply in like  4hrs if you have other questions. Then i sleep shortly after.
DaniPP — 30/11/25, 22:30
Sounds good, I’ll think about everything carefully. Have a nice night and sweet dreams!
DaniPP — 1/12/25, 17:03
I'm still refining the frontend to clean up the styles and testing different looks to see which style might fit the page best.
Do you have any specific requests or preferences? For example, do you want to use certain colors, do you dislike color gradients, would you prefer a more minimalist style, or should I maintain the structure of the base project versus redesigning the entire structure?
I haven't added the detailed category view tab yet. My current focus is purely on recreating your original frontend using the stack you requested. (Don't worry too much about the current look—I know it seems a bit strange right now. I deliver my projects with better styles; you can check out my portfolio.) I will keep concentrating on this for the time being.

chamero._.

 — 1/12/25, 19:10
Something a tad darker maybe? Not sure that I'm fan of the blue. As for the habits and stuff I was tracking were placeholders so a different style or way of tracking would be better.
Oh, I just read that you were recreating my old one. I see. Yeah please redesign into better styles than mine. Main focus: Easy to input and see what I did at a Glance every day. 
DaniPP — 1/12/25, 19:16
Alr, no problem. I'll see if I can get the redesign done by tonight (it's 7 PM now). If not, I should be able to show it to you sometime between tomorrow morning and early afternoon

Sorry I didn’t send this earlier, I wasn’t here. As you can see in the images, this is all the frontend I have done so far; I know it’s in light mode, only using black and white. Since I still don’t know what color palette to use, I focused on building the whole frontend structure first so I can apply the styles later, once you confirm that the structure is sufficient or if you want to add anything else. The names and that kind of stuff are also just placeholders for now. Is there anything I should change? You said you don’t like blue, but what colors might you like? What color do you picture when you imagine opening the app every day to see the tracker? Black for the whole background? What colors do you imagine would look nice to accent certain details? Besides a black background, what would you like as a secondary color? One color for the cards? One color for the borders? And etc, etc.
chamero._.

 — 2/12/25, 20:38
Wow, huge improvment. I'd like color scheme to be light black or dark grey though(I dislike very white ones). I'm very impressed with it though.
Still busy with work right now. I'll try to sit down and figure binance around 3am ish.
We should probably pause here and let me figure out foundation more. I have lots of ideas to get out and may need to change stuff before to make it easier.
Would it be possible voice call in few days?
DaniPP — 2/12/25, 20:52
I can join and listen without any problem, but honestly I have issues with the speaking part myself, and my spoken English is really bad.​
But if it’s just to join, listen to you, and hear all your ideas, I have absolutely no problem with that, bro.
chamero._.

DaniPP — 3/12/25, 10:37
It should be on the same network. I mean, you can send it through another one, but generally each network has its own rules, fees, timings, etc. From my experience over time, BSC is the best one, with low or almost zero fees and fast transactions

No problem, we can start with the that amoun. Once the rest of the funds are released from hold
we can complete the remaining payment as the days go by and we keep developing the app

 — 3/12/25, 11:41
Sure thing, the foundation im still concerned about before we go futher.
I have so many ideas in my head its overwhelming
DaniPP — 3/12/25, 11:42
If you can, write down all your ideas or send me a voice message, or you said you were going to call, and then we can go through everything and see how it looks. Let me see if I can briefly explain what I have so far; give me a moment to check
chamero._.

 — 3/12/25, 11:50
Okay it let me send $14. I tried selling crypto i already had  for a little more but apparently buying the USDT puts hold on that too 😭 
chamero._.

 — 3/12/25, 11:54
There's so much. Im off work friday which would probably be best to gather most ideas. 

I know i want some sort of stats page for example shows last time i drank alcohol,times i drank, times ive eaten a certain food, days worked out, and so on. I'm weird and want to see everything you can thing of 😆
Some way to make a custom tracker so like a blank format where i can add one. Like down the line i may want to track number of times I've cleaned my room or some other random thing. 
DaniPP — 3/12/25, 12:07
Ok, I understand. In fact, I have an idea. How about, instead of adding each item one by one, I develop a system so that if you ever want to create a new widget or integrate something new into a current widget, you can add it without any problems? It would decrease development time, and in the long run, as you say you will use the application for a long time, it would be quite good because you wouldn't need a developer every time you need to add something new. I would simply give you some cards as placeholders, and you choose which one. I can also add a system so that you can move them yourself so that it feels like a 'free' layout design. Maybe also add a small configuration for sizes and things like that so you can change it yourself someday, do you understand?
I mean, someday you want to add, I don't know, let's say in 5 months you start fishing, and you'd like to have a counter for how many fish you catch on X days, or where you've gone fishing, etc. etc. etc. I would give you cards that you can select yourself to make your own new category, and I'd give you specific data that you can add per card with specific positions, meaning image, description, title, counter, time, I don't know what else it could have. What do you think? And don't worry about the money, you can always send it another time if you can't today.
chamero._.

 — 3/12/25, 12:08
This sounds great
Will some still need to be separate? i think some of the mains ones may be too complex
I dont know anything about it though, your idea might cover it.
Mood tracker

Can track mood mabye 1-10 number system. Let me enter mutiple times a day. Have it track average and low and high for each day. 
DaniPP — 3/12/25, 12:19
I don’t fully understand what you mean by “separate,” but I will make sure that everything inside the tracking section can be managed manually if you want. I’ll probably create a list and a separate page for creation/administration/deletion, the normal CRUD process, where I’ll try to think of a list of options/views so I can also add your 1–10 rating counter with a statistics view. Then I’ll keep creating more and more; I’ll need to think carefully about what to include. I’ll also add the mood tracker as a default option and think in detail about how to make it work
In general, I’d say there’s still a lot to think about and plan

chamero._.

 — 3/12/25, 12:19
Social tracker:

Who i talked to each day and how. Call or text 

Correlations page:

Shows me stuff such as low mood days after drinking, happy mood after lots of social contact ect.

 — 3/12/25, 12:21

DaniPP — 3/12/25, 12:23
Don’t worry, I also understand what it’s like to have an idea built up over years. There’s always something new that comes to mind, especially when it’s in the middle of development. 🥺

Do you have a primary job with regular hours, or are you free most of the day time to talk?
DaniPP — 3/12/25, 19:05
Don't worry about it. I currently have university studies, which take up about 3 hours of my day. Afterward, I work on a commission or two, or look for new ones, as a single commission is usually not enough to keep me stable. However, I always work from home and I'm available almost all day.
You can contact me whenever you want; it might take me a little longer or less to respond, but I'm rarely out or without time, as I manage unforeseen circumstances efficiently.
For a call, let me know in advance and I'll organize my schedule. I can confirm another time if necessary.
If it's a message, send it to me and I'll reply as soon as possible. I spend most of my time programming and I avoid taking on more projects than I can handle daily. Since I study from home, I can respond to messages almost at any time
DaniPP — 3/12/25, 22:55
Today I dedicated everything to seeing if I can deliver a document with the details of how everything is, what's next to be implemented, possible color palettes and features, etc. I don't know if it will be ready by tomorrow, but there you have all the planning we've done up to now.
chamero._.

chamero._.

 — 5/12/25, 13:49
Okay sounds good
DaniPP — 5/12/25, 21:57
What we already have is what you've seen: the desktop application, the styles are currently plain white because I haven't touched them yet—it’s just like this to show the functional layout. The asset system is already 100% functional; that is, it stores everything locally, keeping in mind that you want everything to work from your device. So, for now, I am trying to ensure it mostly doesn't need any external services at all.

The assets page is convenient for JPG, SVG, PNG, etc., and allows you to either just use Ctrl+V, or drag and drop, or select files from your folders. These files are transformed so they can be stored locally. There is a staging system for auto-save and for UX, so no processes are run without your permission. As you saw, we have the tracking views that show all the graphs or data for each tracker, and we have the home screen that shows everything at a quick glance. That's what we have accomplished this week, okay?

Now we have the following continuing steps:

 — 5/12/25, 22:02
Alright still fronend UI or did you add some backend?
Sounds good though.  I think money is released on 10th.  I also think we have same time its 10:03pm right now.

Doesn't need to be done now, just incase that needs more foundational work to be able to work later on: 
  and I mentioned wanting  Correlations page:

Shows me stuff such as low mood days after drinking, happy mood after lots of social contact ect. 
DaniPP — 5/12/25, 22:05
The project currently has no backend at all—just a small data flow for images and local storage, but aside from that, it is pure frontend for now

DaniPP — 8/12/25, 23:25
Okay, today I finished the Mood Tracker and the Social Tracker, although I'm not sure how well I did the content inside them. I'm not focusing too much on that part, which leans more towards the real functionalities. I'm still trying to finish the frontend. As I told you, I was going to be developing the Custom Layout and the Custom Tracker System all this week, and I have good news: I might have it ready between tomorrow or the day after. I already have the foundation; I just need to fix a few problems, test everything is fine, configure one or two little issues, and the system would be ready
chamero._.

I am still thinking of anything that may need to be done before we go further.
DaniPP — 9/12/25, 9:25
Let me know if you have any new ideas or anything
DaniPP — 9/12/25, 23:41
Today I couldn't make much progress; I just spent the day fixing some bugs and improving the UX of the current system. I also added a color palette similar to what you requested, but it’s not the final one. Aside from that, I finished most of the code, as I mentioned. I still need to fix a few details.
I’ll check tomorrow, once all the problems are fully resolved, how I can upload videos, because here I have issues due to the size. As you can see, there’s a difference between both screens since I changed the position of the blocks. Tomorrow I’ll see if I can send you a video.

Stats Page

Still want this, im not sure if you were able to include everything im thinking of in just custom tracker and it may be better to have it diff from custom tracker. Would be something that keeps everything so I can add random things and see #'s. For instance I can see how many eggs i've eaten total, weekly,yearly,ect. Or total weights kg/lb's lifted. Last time I ate fast food: 33 days ago, Last time i ate Tacos for example would pull the last time  I logged it in food and say : 09-23-2022 or something.(this is likely main concern with foundation since i will want to retroactively go back and find some type of infomation, im not sure if its all already easily found and calculaed with sql or if you need to specify a lot)

------

Move Assets and Custom trackers to bottom since theyre less used on day to day basis(above streak counter).

-----

Overall I like the look, but I need a bit more functional. I want to quickly log all the infomation daily and it clooks a little tediuous right now wiht just a +  unless that it popping out a screen where i can quickly selected past entries or my most used ones ect so i can quickly click them . I like the Social interactions and little icons its cool, i will aslo want ot use small bubbles for people letters for ones with no added picture otherwise ill add picture for each person so i can see it in the card. Similar With TV,Gaming mabye small squares or whatever for those so ican tell what i did at a glance. We can work on that later since we dont have assets and stuff but thats the end goal I want. 

------

I'm very appreciatve of the work and professionalism you've showed so far. 
I'm free saturday 13th at 5pm-8pm? If you're avaiable to talk mabye we can talk out few more things about what i want and  we can talk $.  Money should be released sometime today and I'll send some of it over. 
DaniPP — 10/12/25, 20:08
Sorry for the late reply, it was a very busy day.

Regarding your new ideas, I will move the items you requested in the sidebar to the bottom, just as you asked. Btw, maybe I got a little too excited, honestly Electron is giving me some problems with the Custom Layout, and the elements are not moving as we planned. I need to figure out how to solve it. I hope to have it ready by 10 p.m. tonight, but if not, it might take me until Thursday. Regardless, as I had planned, I would be developing that system all this week. I apologize if it stretches until Friday, I will try to solve it as soon as possible.

Great, I will add the Advanced Statistics Page to the planning. This weekend, along with the call, I will create the new planning for next week. Don't worry about the advanced queries to the database; as long as we handle the data structure correctly, there won't be any problem.

About the call: Saturday at 8 p.m. sounds good to me. If I see I'm free at 5 p.m., I will let you know. Is it okay if I record the call so I don't miss any details?

[Experimental and Personal Section]

By the way, this is purely experimental and personal, I apologize for the inconvenience. I don't know if you plan on paying for maintenance in the future, but if you like, alongside the maintenance, I can add an AI model to the application. (I don't plan on making it custom from scratch, because that would be mostly experimental and very time-consuming, but if you need something functional and like the idea, I can make small adjustments to an existing functional AI to integrate it into the application).

In fact, an idea that just occurred to me is that we could make an AI that detects your patterns and can give you recommendations or something similar. (By the way, please excuse the lack of professionalism here; this is more of a personal idea for your project. Don't take it too seriously, I just enjoy programming AI and thought it would fit the type of project well. Sorry for the trouble.)

No worries about late reply. I'm often sleeping or working so it's no rush. I'd prefer not to have call recorded. If your English listening isn't the best we could go slower or just skip it and keep texting. I just felt that rambling to you may spark some ideas and can get instant feedback from you.

I want privacy oriented too, so feeding it into ai is not ideal. If it was self hosted ai with a 1080ti gtx mabye , but I'm not sure. Isn't there a simple way to find correlations or is AI the best and im not sure If it hallucinates with smaller tasks like that?

You can explain the current ai system you have and I'll hear it out though.

I went ahead and sent $50 more.

DaniPP — 12/12/25, 12:56
Hi, yes, the payment came through. I apologize for disappearing; I had a few issues these past few days that were quite draining.

Regarding the AI: You're right. Instead of an actual AI model, it would be better to implement an advanced statistical algorithm to handle what you asked for, leaving the AI aside. I definitely plan to keep everything running locally since I understand privacy is a priority for you.

About the call: To be honest, my English listening isn't perfect, so I would likely spend most of the time typing my responses during the call. If that works for you, that's fine by me. However, if you prefer to stick to text/chat, that’s no problem either—I can adapt to whatever you prefer.

btw, the $50 did arrive successfully.

Today, after dealing with so many errors, I am finally fixing the last bugs in the Custom Layout System. I am very confident that I will finally wrap up this part (which was planned for this week) tonight. I’ll send you a video update at 10 PM.

 — 12/12/25, 13:08
Okay!
DaniPP — 12/12/25, 23:16
I'm still working on properly implementing the system in the other views, but the tasks view is fully functional as it should be—those errors are just from placeholders. I'm currently implementing the custom trackers and custom widgets system, which I should have ready by tomorrow. Today I finished the custom layout system though—the custom tracker is halfway working, just needs a few tweaks. Next week I'll do what you asked for + polish each individual view. I think I'll go to sleep for tonight. Have a good night bro!

 — 13/12/25, 19:36
Looks great, always impressing me.
Quick thought: Add button to move task to tomorrows tasks(have it populate if i go to the next day). Keep it on preivous day still just have it highlght a color to indicate it was pospotoned to tomorrow instead of checkmark. 

this is not important just put on backburner for later. 
DaniPP — 14/12/25, 1:34
Hi, sorry I was gone for a while today. I told you I'd send the video with the corrections for the mistakes you see. Later I'll see if I can send you next week's plan... I'm currently away from home with some issues, so I couldn't do any of that. I apologize for taking so long to get the assignments due this week. I'm going back home tomorrow and won't have any other responsibilities, so I can do both. Have a good night. By the way, I was online just to say that. I have to go now, so I'll send you the video and the plan later. As always, sorry for the inconvenience.
chamero._.

 — 14/12/25, 1:35
okii, get some sleeps
DaniPP — 15/12/25, 23:11
Apologies for the delay. Generally, if I am not available during the day, I will always try to be online between 10 and 11 PM. In any case, here is the plan for this week:

Phase 2 Task List: Logic & Persistence:
Local Database Implementation (High Priority) The client was very specific: they want to be able to search for things like "The last time I ate tacos" or "How many eggs did I eat in 2024." This cannot be done with simple flat JSON storage; you need SQL (SQLite or SQL Server LocalDB). Task: Design and create the database schema. Key Detail: Do not just store "Calories: 500". You must store granular data: Entry: { Item: "Tacos", Tags: ["Fast Food", "Mexican"], Quantity: 3, Date: timestamp }. Goal: Ensure the database supports granular and retroactive queries.
Connect UI with Real Logic (CRUD) Currently, your trackers (Weight, Mood, Social) use mock data. You need to connect them to the database created in Step 1. Task: Ensure that clicking "Save" in the Mood Tracker actually writes to the local DB. Task: Update charts to read from the real DB, not a fixed array.
UX: Smart "Quick Entry" (Client Request) The client complained that the + button was tedious if it always opened an empty form. Task: Refactor the + button behavior. New Feature: On click, it should open a pop-over or menu displaying "Recent Entries" or "Frequent Items" to allow 1-click logging.
UX: Visual and Navigation Adjustments Small changes explicitly requested by the client to improve visual cleanliness. Sidebar: Move the Assets and Custom Trackers tabs to the very bottom of the sidebar (since they are used less frequently). Social Tracker: If a contact has no photo, display a circle with their initials (e.g., "JD"). Gaming/TV: Use small colored squares or icons in the dashboard card to identify the activity at a glance (Glanceability).
Statistics Page (Stats Page) This is the new view requested by the client. Task: Create the "Advanced Statistics" view. Logic: Implement simple mathematical algorithms (averages, streaks, frequency) to show correlations without using AI. (e.g., "Your low mood days usually follow alcohol consumption").
This message "Quick thought: Add button to move task to tomorrows tasks(have it populate if i go to the next day). Keep it on preivous day still just have it highlght a color to indicate it was pospotoned to tomorrow instead of checkmark.
this is not important just put on backburner for later. "

Weekly Plan:
Monday/Tuesday: SQL Database Design and connection of the first tracker (e.g., Weight/Mood).
Wednesday: "Quick Entry" System (History and Favorites).
Thursday: Sidebar adjustments and visual details (initials bubbles).
Friday: First version of the Statistics and Correlations Page.

And this is what I finished last week (Week 1), where we developed the application skeleton and the following:
Custom Tracker System: Ability to define new trackers.
Default Trackers (Mocked): Weight, Mood, Social, etc., currently using mock data.
Assets View: Interface for managing local images/assets.
General Dashboard View: The main home screen.
Custom Layout Engine: Drag-and-drop grid system for widgets.
Color Palette: Implementation of the dark-mode/purple-accent theme.
Btw, sorry for disappearing this weekend. I was finishing up my university finals, and my aunt was dealing with some health issues. I should be totally free this week to get back to the normal workflow. Week 1 definitely took a bit longer than I expected, but we're back on track.
Also, don't hesitate if you have any questions or if some crazy idea pops into your head while you're having your coffee. Feel free to throw any idea my way! I'll let you know if it's feasible code-wise, how we could implement it, or if it's worth the effort. I might toss some ideas your way too without hesitation.
Quick question: How would you feel if I sent video updates every weekend, and during the week I just send screenshots/images or a written daily devlog? That way I don't have to upload a video every single day.
Anyway, I'm heading to sleep now. Have a great night, bro!

Goodnight!, no worries on delay again. I understand life happens. I'm not that big of a rush still.

 — 17/12/25, 16:40
weekend vids are fine
DaniPP — 18/12/25, 13:02
Oh sorry, I honestly could have sworn I sent the message yesterday. It was this one (have a nice day btw):

Alright, so I'll aim to record the video by the weekend. Honestly, I made a lot of progress between yesterday and today. I think I might even have everything for this week done by tomorrow. However, considering what happened last week (where I finished on Wednesday but had to spend time fixing bugs and polishing error handling), it might stretch into the weekend. But so far, I haven't run into any issues. If everything goes perfectly, I might send you the video tomorrow, bro, but most likely it'll be over the weekend. That's pretty much it for my update today. Have a good night!
DaniPP — 20/12/25, 23:43
Hi, I haven't been in touch because there haven't been any major breakthroughs. This week's work was mostly minimal; I was just polishing a few details. Like last week, I'll be sending the video tomorrow. I don't know how you've been, but I hope you're doing well! Have a good day, good afternoon, and good night!
chamero._.

 — 20/12/25, 23:53
All good
DaniPP — 22/12/25, 23:42
Hi, I didn't get a chance to tell you yesterday, sorry. It has bugs, and I think it's my fault, we're still in development, but I don't like sending tests with bugs, mainly because it's a bit embarrassing to show something that isn't fully functional or looks bad... Also, my own schedule is making it hard to fix the bugs quickly. I think I'm trying to push the project too fast, even though you told me there was no need to rush. I was trying to send you the MVP app as soon as possible. Honestly, I don't know when I'll fix the bugs, so to avoid giving any more specific dates and leave you waiting, I'd say between Thursday and next Tuesday... Since there aren't any other things to do, if you don't mind, I'll send the tests as they are, keeping the conversation more genuine and, well, lightening things up a bit instead of rushing. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and for not being able to fulfill the plan that I myself gave before last week.
chamero._.

 — 23/12/25, 0:12
I appreciate the honestly. Are you working on it alone and how heavily reliant on AI?
DaniPP — 23/12/25, 8:47
Hi, just woke up. Yes, it's just me working on this.

Regarding the AI, I use it as a force multiplier. I act as the architect. I plan all the logic, flows, and structure first. Then I use AI to help generate the bulk of the code to get a working base quickly. After that, I manually review, test, and edit the code to fix issues and polish the details. It allows me to work faster than a single dev usually could, but the logic is 100% mine.
DaniPP — 23/12/25, 8:59
I'm trying to clear some things so I can dedicate more time to this. Since it's the beginning of the project, there are some parts I haven't touched yet, so the code is still very AI-driven. I'm trying to free up time on one of the projects I should finish today so I can dedicate more time to this one, because currently I'm only spending 1 to 2 hours on it. Once I'm free, which should be this afternoon or evening because I'm close to finishing it, I can make the necessary changes. And once I make the manual changes, honestly, the whole project becomes much more workable. The bugs aren't a problem, just a few things in my schedule. That's why I extended this part of the project a bit. Today, as I said, I'll finish this project and start focusing fully on habit flow (that's basically what I need to say).
chamero._.

 — 23/12/25, 14:17
Alright sounds okay then. I know i keep adding and making things more complex. If it becomes too much for you please let.me know. Im perfectly fine paying you to help me just with planning and frontend to see how itll grow and can find another for functionality. You're the best I've found for understanding my vision thus far and have plently of stuff to have you do either way.
DaniPP — 24/12/25, 0:49
Honestly, I don't have any problems with full stacking, I just didn't plan on getting so busy around Christmas, haha. But thanks, if I have any problems I won't hesitate to let you know, but for now everything's fine. I've finished the project I had on hold, I'm much freer now, thanks for your understanding, it's much appreciated. Tomorrow I'll start iterating on each part of the app. Sorry for being a bit inactive. Good night btw and have a great day tomorrow!!

chamero._.

 — 24/12/25, 3:20
Just making sure. Thanks, and merry Christmas/happy holidays to you tomorrow if you celebrate!

 — 25/12/25, 19:53
I have quite a bit of time off for 3 days and then another 3-4 days off near New Years day. So I'm trying think of more ideas and stuff that we can add or change to the exisitng one. 
If you're able to send the files sometime during that I can do some testing and see if it feels good ect.
If you're too busy with christmas next few days thats understandable. I hope you had a great christmas.
DaniPP — 26/12/25, 22:10
Hi, sorry for being so disconnected. I was at my grandma's for Christmas and I'm on my way home now. I'll arrive in the early hours of the morning, take a nap, tweak the app to make it testable enough, and then I'll send you the GitHub repository. Leave your GitHub email here (I don't know if you use it) to keep the repository private. I'll be uploading all the code around 3-5 pm. By the way, I hope you had a wonderful holiday season, and I hope you enjoy New Year's Eve!
chamero._.

 — 26/12/25, 22:10
alll gooood
i off 31st-4th
can just aiim for that timeline
rest a little 🤗 
DaniPP — 26/12/25, 22:11
Thank you, you have a nice night too!
chamero._.

 — 27/12/25, 5:52
I'll have to make github first i suppose
DaniPP — 27/12/25, 11:42
Yeah, once you create it, send me the email you used to create it so I can invite you to the private repository. From there, I'd just need to upload the code. If I'm not mistaken, you should get a notification when you update, but I'll let you know anyway
DaniPP — 27/12/25, 23:17
Hey, I've been thinking about what you mentioned the other day, and I'm going to take you up on that offer.
I'll aim to have everything ready by Dec 30th-31st. That way, during your days off, you can actually test a version that feels solid and 'real.' I’d honestly prefer not to hand over the code in its current state—the video I sent was mostly a visual preview of the direction we're heading, but I want to polish the actual logic and details so it's fully testable for you.
Here's a small example of the changes needed for "real-world" use, because the automatic tracking only had a "view" option when I showed you the video. After that, we'll see what happens with the feedback you provide regarding the necessary changes after you've tested everything. I'm going to sleep now, by the way. I fixed most of the minor issues; only these changes remain. Goodnight!
Imagen
DaniPP — 31/12/25, 9:51
Hey! Happy New Year! I don't want to bother you too much on a holiday, but I wanted to let you know that the core logic is coded and ready for a test drive.
There are still some details being polished, and you might notice some data on the Home view isn't fully connected to the backend yet, but it's functional enough for you to get a real feel for the UX and the app's flow. I’ve been trying to make it 'perfect' before showing you, but I realized it's a long project and it's better for you to test the experience now while I finish wiring up the rest of the data.
Hope you have an amazing New Year's Eve and a great start to 2026! whenever you get a chance (no rush at all, enjoy your day off), send me your email so I can invite you to the repo. Enjoy!

DaniPP — 5/1/26, 22:08
Hi, it's already January 5th, I suppose you're very busy and that's why you haven't sent the email, but I don't want you to worry or anything, so here's the application code:
https://github.com/PapLion/Chimero 
GitHub
GitHub - PapLion/Chimero
Contribute to PapLion/Chimero development by creating an account on GitHub.
Contribute to PapLion/Chimero development by creating an account on GitHub.
If you'd like to try the app, you'll need to install the zip file manually since you don't have the application from GitHub.

The steps are:
Click on "code"
Click on "download - zip"
Unzip the zip file
Open the terminal
Navigate to the directory where you saved the folder using the terminal
Run npm install and after everything is installed, run the command npm run post-install
You then have two options (web [more convenient for testing] and desktop). You can run npm run dev (this will run the web version) or npm run electron:dev (this will run the desktop version).

The code is still prone to some bugs, but as I make optimizations, they will appear there periodically. I update the code, and you can test it yourself after each update or after I announce a major update to the code.
DaniPP — 5/1/26, 22:16
Since there are no pending plans, I will be constantly dedicating myself to fixing the existing bugs in the current code.

I hope you're having a wonderful day and enjoying yourself!
chamero._.

 — 5/1/26, 23:21
Yes, I've been busy sorry.  I'll get back to you on all this. Sounds good on bug fixes.
DaniPP — 9/1/26, 9:51
Don't worry, I'm trying to fix as many bugs as I can by the weekend. I'll commit on Sunday, fixing as many as I can by then. Don't worry, there's no rush. When you have more free time, send me your ideas for what you'd like to add, or any issues you have with the current system, or anything else you're thinking about. I'll be happy to tell you if it's technically possible to add it or fix it as usual. Good luck with whatever's keeping you busy!
DaniPP — 13/1/26, 0:18
Hi, sorry I haven't been around. I've been a bit busy. Basically, the bugs I fixed are mostly backend bugs. The logic for the internal data manipulation and management wasn't the best and was going to cause problems in the long run. Basically, all I did was implement better management.

Pending bugs include things like:
Individual visualization of each tracker (frontend)
Front and backend management of custom trackers, which is a bit messed up
Data management (backend)
Improving the calendar functionality (it's incomplete)
Polishing the overall UX
Data consistency for each view

I'd really like to focus on the backend this week. Anyway, that's all. Sweet dreams and have a great day!
chamero._.

 — 13/1/26, 3:44
Alright I'll try to get on to test it and see where we're going on Thursday morning.
chamero._.

 — 15/1/26, 1:51
I was unable to run it as app(error in image). I managed to load webversion. It seems decent enough. Overflow issue atleast in web where i cant see trackers well. Also the nextjs? i think your using it shows the coimple time and render time., is it normal for the comple to take up to 500ms sometimes or is that just a web thing? it just feels a little delayed when clicking between the trackers. 
Imagen
I'm aware you said you were already working for thge bug fixes and want to start with backend. I agree and think we should just get this working,polished, and pay you the rest before working on new features. Good work so far though.

DaniPP — 21/1/26, 0:18
Hi, sorry for the slightly complicated days, it always happens to me at the beginning of the year. I've already read the bug reports and I know I haven't uploaded a commit since last week, so I didn't meet the weekly commit, but I'm trying to do a global fix. 500ms isn't normal; it's just that until now I was trying to have a more workable base so I could focus more on the visual details, focusing more on the core than the aesthetics to be able to work better. So I'm trying to make a bigger, more general commit, as I said. 

I've finished the projects I had on my plate; for now, I'm only working on this one. I'm trying to focus on the mega-commit to resolve most things, working full time on it all this week. Sorry for being a bit absent, it wasn't in my plans. 

Sweet dreams and thank you for the hard work. I'm going to sleep for now. I'll continue tomorrow; I'm a little tired, so I'm going to sleep. Have a good rest.
chamero._.

 — 21/1/26, 5:58
Okay, glad 500ms can be fixed. 
DaniPP — 26/1/26, 13:55
Hello~ the project has reached a key point: the MVP is fully functional and the core system is defined. Recent updates have fixed backend and logic issues, so this demonstrates how the final product will behave
However... because I prioritized the speed of the prototype, we're facing technical debt that limits scalability and performance. Continuing with the current structure is possible, but inefficient in the long run
I sincerely propose a Technical Consolidation Phase. Migrating the validated logic to a more robust architecture designed for growth.
This will result in:
Improved performance and fewer errors.
Clearer code logic for easier maintenance.
Stability and speed when adding new features.
I've already been doing this with the backend, but I'd like to do it with the frontend as well...
It will take approximately one week to configure the core structure. Maximum total time (2-3 weeks): Including final adjustments and adding more features
This is basically to delay things a bit now, but it will make future development significantly faster and more predictable. Since the MVP has already worked and proven the functionality of the idea, I would opt to do this. But if you prefer it to be faster, what I could do is continue with the current code, but it would take a little longer to fix bugs and add features
I said this because basically both paths are viable; the point is when we do the stage that "takes time"—now or later. I'm not having problems with the backend because it was something new, but the frontend is more complete, and that would take the time I mentioned. But we can go with whichever one is more comfortable for you. I already made the commit last night, by the way. You can't see many things because I didn't touch the frontend much after realizing what I was saying; most of the improvements are internal and logical. I'll keep improving the architecture, but let me know which is more comfortable for you, so I can focus on just one instead of archetyping with both options in mind. Have a nice day, by the way, and sorry for the delay! These days have been a bit more problematic for me personally, nothing worrying, it's just that sometimes it takes time unintentionally, so I'm not always here
chamero._.

 — 26/1/26, 14:03
Delaying for better code is good, but i was kinda waiting to pay you another part when it was somewhat working and then another after it was more polished again.
DaniPP — 26/1/26, 15:42
I understand... The current version of the system already works in general terms as I told you, so instead of making a sudden change or redoing the front from scratch, what I will do will be a controlled refactor during this week, so I align myself with what you say.
The approach would be something more like maintaining everything that already works and preserving the base of the backend, but working on the most critical points that are affecting the stability and the general experience. I will mainly focus on:
-Improve frontend stability
-Change a few frameworks that I am using that generate problems
-Optimize performance in components that are slower today
-Fix errors that may cause crashes later
-Polish some UI details that impact usability
I would not be doing a restart of the project, but rather a consolidation phase on what already exists in a less extreme way, looking for an approach where something functional is sought and the foundation is strengthened so that the improvements are integrated without generating new problems.
I will continue with the dynamic of weekly commits then, so this weekend I should be uploading a more polished and stable version in terms of the visual layer and the use of the current system, so we move forward in the way you propose. Basically a 50/50 or rather 30/70
chamero._.

 — 26/1/26, 16:29
Strethenged foundation sounds like best idea. Alright thanks

DaniPP — 2/2/26, 23:30
Hi, I'm pleased to say I’ve finished the new architecture. The codebase is now much cleaner, and I’ve fixed all the errors that existed in the previous architecture. In the current version, there are no remaining errors. The project is now ready to keep adding more and more features without having to worry so much about the foundations.

Sorry for not starting the MVP with a solid architecture from the beginning — that was bad practice on my part. Optimization is also much better now. The project currently uses Vite + Electron instead of Next.js + Electron, which I was using before.

The code is now completely free of mock files as well. That said, there aren’t many trackers available to add yet. To finish the architecture, I only created 3 widget types — the ones shown in the image. Since there isn’t much data yet, the app looks a bit empty and lacking color, but of course that will change with usage.

Tomorrow I’ll work on the CI/CD section, and after that I’ll review the chat again to add all the widget types you requested. From now on, making style changes or implementing new features won’t be a problem anymore.

DaniPP — 5/2/26, 10:52
It's a routing issue on my end. Windows allows relative paths, but Linux/Mac requires absolute paths. Don't worry about your configuration. I'm fixing the code right now to make it compatible with Linux/Mac. I'll commit it shortly 😓

DaniPP — 5/2/26, 16:37
Sorry for the delay, I've fixed the error. Btw, I tested it on Arch Linux and I have a few things not fully configured, so I encountered some errors related to window creation. However, it doesn't affect production or the application. I don't know if this will happen to you, but I'm letting you know: if you see a warning message or a simple error log below "scheme ok", it doesn't affect the application. I took the opportunity to finish a commit I had half-done in CI/CD and to improve the user experience and the crawler interface
To run it, it's the same: run the application with "pnpm install" (install it if you don't already have it; I forgot to mention it before, but I assume you do) and "pnpm dev". That's all you need to try it

It looks pretty good, I went ahead and sent another $50. Main Issues I see so far is I'm unable to grab the title bar and move the application its stuck and i cant move it. When i try to create custom tracker it overflows too far vertically where i cant see the top or bottom. I added asset and it's not asking me what type it is so when i try to add a picture to a social person I added it doesn't populate(social also wasnt a category in assets, i suppose it should be).
Not sure but it is worth mentioning I believe I primarialy use "wayland" on arch.

Mmm, yes, I just tried to quickly set up window management, so I implemented it in a way that was quick to test and convenient for development.
Now I'm going to make window usage more flexible; that was my mistake.
And yes, I also need to add more responsive details.
Regarding resources, I got it to automatically detect the file type, but I forgot to add a proper user experience to that section... sorry.
And yes, there were also some details in the assets window who missed up. I was so focused on the predefined widgets in the custom widgets section, the sidebar, and how dates are handled, that I forgot to properly review the content of the resources section.

Thanks for the feedback, by the way; it helps more than you might think; there are small details that can easily be overlooked.
And don't worry about Wayland, btw, but I can think about how to improve the Wayland user experience somehow; I'll see.

For the rest of the week, I'll review everything we discussed in the chat about the app's current state and future features i need to add and compare it to its actual state. Based on that, I'll identify the remaining tasks and start working on them.
I'll continue to provide updates as I reach different stages of implementation, just like I have been doing these past few days. When I think there's something solid or a major update, I'll let you know so you can start testing, or you can keep an eye out for updates and test things on your own if you'd like.
And remember, you can still give me all the ideas you have; I'll schedule them one by one.
